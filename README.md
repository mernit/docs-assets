# Functions

This app demonstrates a few things:

1. You can wrap any code in a `function()` decorator to run it on the cloud
2. You can invoke a function locally with `.local()`
3. You can invoke a function _remotely_ with `.remote()`
4. You can fan out workloads to hundreds or thousands of containers with `.map()`

In your shell, run this script by running `python [app.py]`.

The logs from the remote container runtime will stream back to your shell, and you can watch as
the remote code is executed in the cloud.

The `.map()` method in `main()` spawns 5 remote containers, but that number is arbitrary.

You can change `5` to `500`, and invoke this function again -- you'll see 500 containers spin up almost instantly.
